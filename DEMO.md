Solution:

1. Use `sameSite: true`

- **Strict**: will strict all the request. It mean all the request will not attach cookie if you sent from different site

  > Example: you click a link to redirect to your facebook profile (not from facebook), you have to login again if facebook set `sameSite: strict`. This is because you access to facebook from another site, it will not sent along with cookie in the request

- **Lax**: will sent cookie for GET request -> cause this is safety request as definition in 4.2.1 of RFC 7321

Conclusion:

- CSRF attacks comprise a good percentage of web-based attacks. It is crucial to be aware of the vulnerabilities that could make our website a potential target for CSRF attacks and prevent these attacks by building proper CSRF defenses in our application.

- A CSRF attack leverages the implicit trust placed in user session cookies by many web applications.
- To prevent CSRF attacks, web applications need to build mechanisms to distinguish a legitimate request from a trusted user of a website from a forged request crafted by an attacker but sent by the trusted user.
- An (anti-)CSRF token is a random string shared between the userâ€™s browser and the web application and is a common type of server-side CSRF protection.

- Common implementation techniques of CSRF Tokens known as :

  - Using `csrf_token`
  - Using `sameSite`, `httpOnly`, or `secure`

- If your website don't using cookie, ignore this
